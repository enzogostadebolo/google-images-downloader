<h1>Google images downloader with requests-html</h1>
<p>Using requests-html, this program download google images in the best possible quality. </p>

<ul>
  <li>This program can only download 400 images because google uses a lot of js, and there is a limitation using scrolldown</li>
  <li>maybe your images folder has a little less than what you asked for, that's because some srcs must be "broken", and the program just skips them</li>
  <li>if rendering functions are slow just change sleep duration</li>
</ul>
